Rules
======
To become a Werewolf, you have to get bitten (attacked) by a wolf or Werewolf at night and contract the Werewolf infection. This infection will turn the player into a Werewolf every night, starting the next night, if the player is under a open sky. To prevent turning, the player can stay inside during night.

* When in wolf-form, character skin changes to a Werewolf skin (Only visible to other players)
* When in wolf-form, players will become identifiable only as "Werewolf" in the playerlist and chat (Adding a element of mystery)
* When in wolf-form, werewolves speak in a language which appears as growling noises to normal players.
* A Werewolf automatically turns into his Wolf-form during a full moon, when under a open sky.
* A Werewolf automatically turns into his Human-form at dawn.
* A Werewolf only eats meat!
* A Werewolf gains health from killing mobs (Hunting)
* A Werewolf does high unarmed damage
* A Werewolf moves faster
* A Werewolf jumps higher
* A Werewolf has night vision.
* A Werewolf cannot wield Armor while in Wolf-form, but has a high natural defense
* A Werewolf can growl with /growl
* A Werewolf can howl with /howl
* Vampires cannot be infected with the Werewolf infection
* When a Werewolf gets killed, the player re-spawns in human form.
* Werewolves are very vulnerable to silver weapons.
* Werewolves are flock creatures and live in clans
* Werewolves are the natural leaders of wild wolves
* The Werewolf infection can be cured by drinking the werewolf cure potion
